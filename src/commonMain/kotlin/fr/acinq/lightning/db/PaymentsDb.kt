     * On-chain-related payments are not instant, but needs to be displayed as soon as possible to the user
     * for UX purposes. They affect the balance differently whether they are incoming or outgoing.
     *
     * For example, if a user initiates a swap-in, they will expect to see an incoming payment immediately in
     * their payment history, even if the amount isn't included in the balance and the funds are not spendable right
     * away. Conversely, after a swap-out, the balance is immediately decreased even if the transaction is not confirmed.
     *
     * Note that this is all related to transaction confirmations on the blockchain, but involves a bit more than
     * that, because both sides of the channel need to agree, and they may also agree to not require any confirmation.
     *
     * Incoming payments (channel creation or splice-in) are considered confirmed when the corresponding funds are added
     * to the balance and can be spent. Before that, they should appear as "pending" to the user.
     *
     * Outgoing payments (splice-out or channel close) are considered confirmed when the corresponding funding transaction
     * is confirmed on the blockchain. Before that, they should appear as "final" to the user, but with some indication that
     * the transaction is not yet confirmed. In the case of a force-close, the outgoing payment will only be considered confirmed
     * when the channel is closed, meaning that all related transactions have been confirmed.
